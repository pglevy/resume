I believe in the power of design thinking and doing as a positive force for the healthy growth and continuous improvement of mission-driven organizations. I’m currently focused on expanding access to software design and development through low-code platform tools. I do this by improving the planning and execution of design activities and fostering an environment where designers are motivated, challenged, and happy about doing their best work.
